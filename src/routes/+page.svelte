          James can read and remember entire books, articles, and web pages. He
          can also answer your questions about what he has read, but don't try
          to trick him, he's smarter than you.

          With James by your side, you will probably never need to study again,
          but if you do, he can help you with that too. He can make flashcards,
          answer questions, and even help you with your homework (but don't tell
          your teacher).

          James can swallow up entire documentation pages so you don't have to.
          If you have a question about a programming language or framework, he
          can hopefully answer it. He can also help you with your code, but he's
          not very good at it yet.

          Please let James read all your personal notes and thoughts. He
          promises he won't tell anyone. He can also answer your questions and
          have a conversation with you.
